# Blogs-web-App

A basic web application in Node.js and MongoDB that allows the user to login, register, logout, post, 
delete, and edit a blog.  
This app focuses on basic security concepts of web apps like JWT tokens for authorization and 
authentication, so no one can edit or delete your blog. 
Also, the security of data is ensured by using parameterized queries, filtering input before storing it in 
the database, and hashing DB tables.
